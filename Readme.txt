Description:
Checkers is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard.
One player has the 'X' soldiers, the other has the 'O' soldier.
Players alternate turns.
A player may not move an opponent's soldiers.
A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square.
If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the soldier may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.

How to play:
the user need to insert the board size and if he wants to play against human player or computer.
every player will insert in his turn the source square that he want his soldier will move and the destination square, in the following format:
COLrow>COLrow ( for example Af>Be).
the soldier that will arrive to the far side of the board, whether by means of a jump or a simple move, becomes a King, and the move terminates.
the first player that will capture all the enemy's soldiers is the winner!

Good luck!
